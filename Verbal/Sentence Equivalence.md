# Pairing Strategy (Useful for 99.9% Qs)
Initially, you have a low chance of getting the right options:
    
  - First word, 2/6 chance
  - Second word, 1/5 chance
  - Overall chance = 1/15, which is about 6.6%. Jeez!
 
 The pairing strategy improves this by eliminating unlikely answers, as the correct answer is always in pairs. So you're odds then become 50% which is a lot better than 6.6%. Here's how it goes:

1. Don't read the sentence! Directly look at the answer choices.
2. Find pairs of two, similar meaning words and write the letters of pairs down on your whiteboard.
3. If any words are left that don't make a pair, eliminate them.
4. Now read the sentence.
5. Select the pair that makes the most sense and matches the tone.
