Reading Passages

# Simplify The Passage Strategy
1. Read the sentence and write out it's simplest point.
   *NOTE*: Don't over generalise and lose the nuance
2. Once simplified, quickly skim over points.
3. When attempting questions, read the answers from bottom to top (E -> A). It's because ETS puts traps in first few options.
