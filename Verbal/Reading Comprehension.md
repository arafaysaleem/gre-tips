Reading Passages

# Simplify The Passage Strategy
1. Read the sentence and write out it's simplest points.
    
   *NOTE*: Don't over generalise and lose the nuance
4. Once simplified, quickly skim over points.
5. When attempting questions, read the answers from bottom to top (E -> A). It's because ETS puts traps in first few options.

# Simplification On Steroids
1. Read each sentence and write out it's sentence function only. Possible sentence functions are:

   - Historical Fact (Usually a statement that nobody would debate, everyone would agree)
   - Common belief (Usually a point that the author will contradict later)
   - Author's Main Idea (Usually a contradiction or opinion, very often starts with negative conjunctions like but, however etc.)
   - Concession (Sort of an attack used by the author to support his argument but partially agrees to the other side as well, so as to limit/qualify the attack)
   - Support Clause (Usually explains the author's main idea)
   - Emphasis (Anything that restates the author's idea)

3. If some sentence is difficult to identify, leave it as it may not be tested. Commonly tested parts are:
   
   - Support Clauses
   - Main Idea
   - Common belief

4. When attempting questions, read the answers from bottom to top (E -> A). It's because ETS puts traps in first few options.

# Words With Importance (For Long Passages)
1. Read each sentence and see if it contains a main meaning changing word. One sentence can have more than one such words. Possible such words are:

   - Negative Conjuctions (Yet, But, However)
   - Supporting/Elaborating Words (Furthermore, Also, As a result)
   - Explanatory/Reasoning Words (Because, the reason being)
   
3. With each important word, try to identify the purpose and function of that sentence. See how it changes the tone of the author. 
4. Don't go into the details of the sentence, leave it as it may not be tested.
5. When attempting questions, read the answers from bottom to top (E -> A). It's because ETS puts traps in first few options.

# CELJ (For Critical Reasoning Qs)
1. Read the entire passage first.
2. Deduce the conclusion `C`
3. State the evidence `E` for that conclusion.
4. Predict the logic jump `LJ` that could weaken or support (as stated in the question) the conclusion.
5. Read the answers from bottom to top (E -> A). It's because ETS puts traps in first few options.
