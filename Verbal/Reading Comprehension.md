Reading Passages

# Simplify The Passage Strategy
1. Read the sentence and write out it's simplest points.
    
   *NOTE*: Don't over generalise and lose the nuance
4. Once simplified, quickly skim over points.
5. When attempting questions, read the answers from bottom to top (E -> A). It's because ETS puts traps in first few options.

# Simplification On Steroids
1. Read each sentence and write out it's sentence function only. Possible sentence functions are:

   - Historical Fact (Usually a statement that nobody would debate, everyone would agree)
   - Common belief (Usually a point that the author will contradict later)
   - Author's Main Idea (Usually a contradiction or opinion, very often starts with negative conjunctions like but, however etc.)
   - Concession (Sort of an attack used by the author to support his argument but partially agrees to the other side as well, so as to limit/qualify the attack)
   - Support Clause (Usually explains the author's main idea)
   - Emphasis (Anything that restates the author's idea)

3. If some sentence is difficult to identify, leave it as it may not be tested. Commonly tested parts are:
   
   - Support Clauses
   - Main Idea
   - Common belief

4. When attempting questions, read the answers from bottom to top (E -> A). It's because ETS puts traps in first few options.
