Text Completion

# Math Strategy (Useful for Single Blank Qs)
1. Don't look at choices
2. Find conjunction and assign it `-1` or `+1` based on tone
3. Read the part without the blank.
4. Find a word with adverb/adjective attached, removing this
should change meaning:
    - If there no word, grab the idea of the sentence in a word
    - Also replace pronouns by the subject
    
    and once done:
    - Identify if it is on left or right of conjunction
    - Assign `-1` or `+1` based on tone
5. Do the math and figure out if blank is `(-ve)` or `(+ve)`
6. Look at the choices to find this word

# Time Contrast Strategy (Useful for Single/Double/Triple Blank Qs)
1. Don't look at the answer choices
2. Figure out if the sentence talks about two different periods like:
    - Past & Present or vice versa
    - Past & Future or vice versa
    - Present & Future or vice versa
3. If two different time periods exist, the blank(s) will usually be opposite to one of the time periods
    - E.g. So if the **past** segment is `(-ve)`, and blank is in the **present** segment, it will have something `(+ve)`
