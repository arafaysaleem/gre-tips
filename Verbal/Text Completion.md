1. Don't look at choices
2. Find conjunction and assign it `-1` or `+1` based on tone
3. Read the part without the blank.
4. Find a word with adverb/adjective attached, removing this
should change meaning:
    - If there no word, grab the idea of the sentence in a word
    - Also replace pronouns by the subject
    
    and once done:
    - Identify if it is on left or right of conjunction
    - Assign `-1` or `+1` based on tone
5. Do the math and figure out if blank is `(-ve)` or `(+ve)`
6. Look at the choices to find this word
