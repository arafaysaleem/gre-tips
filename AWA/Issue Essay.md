The structure can vary a bit on what they are asking and what stance you choose. If you choose `strongly`, then all paras support you and counter is introduced in conclusion only, where it is shutdown. 
But, if you choose `mostly`, you can have 1 concession and 2 support paras, or you can still choose to go with 3 support paras and introduce counter only in the conclusion, where you use it to blur the final argument in favor of **mostly agree**.

# Intro
1. Hook - An introduction of your topic
   
   - A sentence that highlights the issue given in the prompt.

2. Shift to the prompt
   
   - Write "the prompt recommends..." and state the issue prompt as it is given.

3. Thesis - Your opinion

   - Start with "In my opinion..." or "In my mind..."
   - Take a **mostly agree** or **mostly disagree** position. Say "In my opinion, I mostly "agree"/"disagree with this suggestions".
   - Followed by your exact argument. "...and argue that blah blah blah".

4. Outline - Define Your Structure

   - You need to state how many reasons or evidences will you present. 
   - Either join it with the thesis above or write it seperately.

# Body 1 - Concession
Write in support to show you mostly agree only
1. Topic Sentence.

   - Start with words like "In some cases...To some extent...while this is partly observed".
   - Support the opposite side.
   - This neutralizes the opposing stance and creates a concession.
   
2. Examples.

   - Give 1 or 2 examples of your concession argument.

3. Development.

   - Connect your example to your thesis. Show how it affects it. Why this matters.
   - Use words like "above example illustrates that..." or "in light of this example...".
   - Since, this is a concession, you need to cancel the examples and re state your thesis.

# Body 2,3 - Support
1. Topic Sentence.

   - Start with words like "To begin/First of all/Primarily...Secondly/Further".
   - Support the your side.
   - This strenthens your stance and creates a support.
   
2. Examples.

   - Give 1 or 2 examples of your support argument.

3. Development.

   - Connect your example to your thesis. Show how it affects it. Why this matters.
   - Use words like "In other words..." or "according to this example..." or "as indicated by this example...".
   - Affirm your thesis with words such as "Consequently...Thus...".

# Conclusion.

## Mostly Agree/Disagree
   - Explain how the issue is complex and has no clear answers.
   - Restate your thesis.
   - Use a sentence like "Although, I do concede that side A is beneficial in that ..., I mostly favor side B for the above said reasons".

## Strongle Agree/Disagree

   - Introduce a counterpoint that can be used to argue against your position.
   - Shut it down and show how it doesn't apply and doesn't hold water.
   - Rephrase the thesis.
