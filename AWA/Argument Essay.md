**Is the argument ever correct?**

The arguments almost always have flaws, so, you will mostly be disagreeing with the author.

**What do you need to identify when reading?**

1. Author's thesis.
2. The premises, the evidence, or the 'facts' that led the author to this conclusion

**What do look for after identifying?**

1. REASON THE UNSTATED ASSUMPTIONS OUT. 
2. Look for flaws in his assumptions and how they can be countered.

# Structure

## Introduction
1. Rephrase main conclusion from argument

   - Use phrases like, "it is stated that...instead of...".
   
3. Identify author's evidence and/or premises

   - Say it like "He/she/the author/they...have come to this conclusion based on...`evidence 1`, `evidence 2` and `evidence 3`".

5. Thesis (follow the specific task instructions)

   - Start like "However, before this _recommendation/suggestion_ can be properly evaluted, three _questions/reasons_ must be _answered/assesed".
   - The italics parts are subject to change based on the specific task verbiage. If it asks you to ask questions, use that, otherwise go with the other relevant thing.

## Body Paragraph (3 of them)
1. First supporting idea (make sure to follow specific task instructions)

  - Start with words like "Firstly, Secondly, Finally". If questions then use same words with questions e.g. "Firstly, are these ... equal to these..?"
  - You can restate the question if it needs explanation using "In other words...".

2. **Two** Examples

  -  Make sure to use 'maybe' language with phrases such as "It is possible that...Further, there is a possibility that..."
  
3. Effect on author's conclusion if examples prove true. Use sentences like:

  - "If either of these scenarios has merits, then the conclusion drawn in the original argument is significantly weakened".
  - "If the above...situations exist/is true..., then the author's argument doesn't hold water.
  - "If either of these scenarios prove true, then the assertion of the author is significanlt hampered".

## Conclusion
1. Statement that argument, as it stands now, is flawed
2. Request for more evidence

   - "In conclusion, the argument, as it stands now, is considerably flawed due to it's reliance on several unwarranted assumptions."
   - "In conclusion, while the author may have come to a sound conclusion regarding...., more data is needed before a firm conclusion is reached."
   
3. Statement of how evidence will help evaluate the argument more effectively.

   - "If the author is able to answer the above three questions (perhaps in the form of...), it will be possible to fully evaluate the...validity of the argument/viability of the proposed solutions".
